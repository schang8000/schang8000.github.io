I am a fifth year PhD student in Computer Science Department of University of Minnesota. I work in [**GroupLens Research**](http://www.grouplens.org/), adviced by Prof. [**Loren Terveen**](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~terveen/).

My research is about the interaction between human and AI: (1) analyze users' behavior in online communities and personalize their experience with machine learning (Recommender system); (2) leverage crowd wisdom to improve machine learning systems.

**I am on job market now. I am interested in industrial positions that provide opportunities to explore and innovate.**

In my personal life, I love good food, travelling, photography and squash.
