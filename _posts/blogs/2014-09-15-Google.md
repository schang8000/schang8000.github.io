The past summer I had the privilege to work with top-notch HCI research
Ed Chi in Google Research. It has been a very good learning experience
working in a company with cutting edge technology and top experts. I was
very happy to meet some old friends and getting to know a few new
friends.

And I will miss the free food:)
