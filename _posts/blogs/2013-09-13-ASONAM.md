 In the ASONAM conference in Niagara Falls this August, I received the 
 best full paper award for my paper [Routing Questions for Collaborative Answering in Community Question Answering](/papers/asonam13/)
 in collaboration with Aditya Pal who just graduated from GroupLens. 
 
 The paper is about an intelligent question routing algorithm for Stack Overflow, incorporating topic identification, 
 expertise modeling and user compatibility measure. The proposed algorithm is a nice application of graph analysis, natural language processing 
 and time series analysis. Check it out if you are interested!
