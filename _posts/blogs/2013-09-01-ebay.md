This past summer, I had the chance to work in the new founded HCI team in eBay research lab. 
I had a very enjoyable experience working with [Elizabeth Churchill](http://elizabethchurchill.com/â€Ž) 
, [Atish Das Sarma](http://labs.ebay.com/people/atish-das-sarma/), and, of course, the awesome fellow interns.

At eBay, I had the hands on experience working with real "Big Data". Doing 
large scale data analysis using Hadoop is both fun and challenging.
