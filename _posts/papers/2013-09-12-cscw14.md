##Abstract
Pinterest is a popular social curation site where people col-
lect, organize, and share pictures of items. We studied a fun-
damental issue for such sites: what patterns of activity attract
attention (audience and content reposting)? We organized
our studies around two key factors: the extent to which users
specialize in particular topics, and homophily among users.
We also considered the existence of differences between fe-
male and male users. We found: (a) women and men dif-
fered in the types of content they collected and the degree to
which they specialized; male Pinterest users were not partic-
ularly interested in stereotypically male topics; (b) sharing
diverse types of content increases your following, but only
up to a certain point; (c) homophily drives repinning: peo-
ple repin content from other users who share their interests;
homophily also affects following, but to a lesser extent. Our
findings suggest strategies both for users (e.g., strategies to
attract an audience) and maintainers (e.g., content recom-
mendation methods) of social curation sites.
