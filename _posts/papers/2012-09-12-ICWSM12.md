##Abstract
Community Question Answering (CQA) services thrive as
a result of a small number of highly active users, typically
called experts, who provide a large number of high quality
useful answers. Understanding the temporal dynamics and
interactions between experts can present key insights into
how community members evolve over time. In this paper, we
present a temporal study of experts in CQA and analyze the
changes in their behavioral patterns over time. Further, using
unsupervised machine learning methods, we show the interesting evolution patterns that can help us distinguish experts
from one another. Using supervised classiﬁcation methods,
we show that the models based on evolutionary data of users
can be more effective at expert identiﬁcation than the models
that ignore evolution. We run our experiments on two large
online CQA to show the generality of our proposed approach.
